# Finite-Difference-Numerical-Schemes
Set of codes for 5 finite difference schemes to solve partial differential equations.
The code is specific to solve the equations in Computational Gas Dynamics by Laney, chapter 17 and to plot the results and tally them with the text results. The equations are the linear advection and Burger's equation.

The schemes involved are:

Lax Friedrichs Scheme
Lax Wendroff Scheme
Godonov Scheme
Beam Warming Scheme
Fromms Scheme
